## Development

### Requirements

 * Ruby 2.1.3 (preferably installed by [RVM](http://rvm.io/))
 * PostgreSQL 9.3

### Setup

 1. Clone the project and `cd` into it:

        $ git clone https://github.com/thetallgrassnet/pokesite.git
        $ cd pokesite

 2. Bootstrap the application:

        $ bin/setup

    What this does (you don't need to run these commands): install dependencies,

        $ gem install bundler
        $ bundle install

    and set up the database:

        $ bin/rake db:setup

    then clean up logs and temp files and restart the application server if it's
    running.

 3. Start the server:

        $ bin/rails s

#### Updating

    $ git pull
    $ bin/setup

### Testing

    $ bin/rspec
